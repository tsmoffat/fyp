\section{Exploration of Methods Used and Their Suitability}
\label{sec:method_exploration}
The four possible methods that can be used in this project are, as mentioned previously, raw signal simulation, rasterisation, ray tracing and a hybrid method. In this section I will cover their suitability as they relate to this project, as well as explore the methods of transforming SAR raw signals into an actual image.
\subsection{SAR Simulation Methods}
\subsubsection{Raw SAR Simulation}
This is the most robust form of simulation and the most accurate as the individual signals are simulated as well as their reflections. This does have some drawbacks as developing the system in the first place is likely to be quite complex due to the 
\subsection{Image Forming Methods}
There are multiple methods of image formation algorithm.
