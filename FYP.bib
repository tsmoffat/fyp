Some benefits of this approach are exact inversion, ideal motion compensation including topography information and handling of general aperture geometries. The implementation of the Back-Projection Algorithm was done focusing on the parallelization aspects. Applications of the algorithm are presented with respect to topography adaptive processing, direct generation of map projections and consideration of non linear trajectories.},

At first reflection contributions like single or multiple bounce are simulated for a modeled building and compared to a real TerraSAR-X image. It shows how the capability of separating different bounce levels in different layers can support the interpretation of the SAR image.

In this letter, we propose a novel radar imaging simulator that is relatively simple to implement and that finds a balance between accuracy and efficiency. The main goal of the proposed method is to obtain a precise simulation of the geometry of objects in SAR images rather than a detailed radiometric simulation. The simulator is based on an extended ray-tracing procedure to determine which surfaces of a generic object contribute to the backscatter. The backscatter contributions are calculated by means of a Lambertian-specular mixture model. The simulator has already been employed successfully in a methodology for 3-D reconstruction of man-made objects from single detected VHR SAR imagery. Here, we illustrate its work on two rather different structures, a rectangular gable-roof building and an Egyptian pyramid.},

  abstract = {Applications of self-illuminating remote sensing systems, and among those, Radar Imagery is growing rapidly. Unique properties of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system makes it one of the most popular and applicable methods of self illuminating remote sensing techniques for ground deformation monitoring, seismic studies, and many photogrammetry applications. There are several methods and algorithms for processing SAR data, each are convenient for different purposes. Two more common and reliable algorithms are developed in this thesis: a Range Doppler Algorithm and a Chirp Scaling Algorithm. Available software packages and toolboxes for processing SAR data such as DORIS, ROI-PAC, RAT and PULSAR have their advantage and disadvantages. Most of these packages run on Linux platform, are difficult to use, and require quite a few pre-processing data preparations. Besides there is no general SAR processing application that can handle all data types or suitable for all purposes. There are also software packages (such as ROI-PAC) with restrictions for people from certain countries. The objective of this thesis is to process SAR data using two more common algorithms, run a comparison between results of these two algorithms and to process InSAR pair images to form an Interferogram and to create a DEM. A Matlab based program is developed for this purpose with graphical user interface and a few visualization enhancement features, which facilitates processing data and producing desired output. Then, I investigate the effect of different frequency domains in the resulting image. The program I created in my thesis, has several advantages: it is open-source and very easy to modify. The program is coded in MATLAB, therefore it does not need a vast programming knowledge to be able to customize it. You can run it on any platform that can run MATLAB 7+. At the end of this thesis, I conclude that A Range Doppler Algorithm with secondary range compression performed in 2D-frequency domain has a result as good as a Chirp Scaling Algorithm and has less computational complexity and consumes less time. No general SAR processing algorithm could be introduced. Most of the times algorithms need to be adjusted for particular datasets, or particular applications. Besides, the most complicated algorithm is not always the best algorithm. For example, for a point target detection purpose, two filtering steps in range and azimuth direction provides accurate enough result.},

With the rapid development of computer, numerical techniques with no physical approximation play more and more important role in some studies such as electromagnetic scattering from urban scene. We argue that finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is a quite new and promising approach for the propagation in urban areas. In order to numerically evaluate its electromagnetic return to an active microwave sensor, a geometric and electromagnetic model of a typical element of urban structure is presented. It consists of a rectangular parallelepiped whose vertical walls form a generic angle with respect to the sensor line of flight. This parallelepiped is placed on an either smooth or rough surface, to take into account multiple scattering between buildings and terrain. Finally, the above model is used to analyze the field backscattered from a building, as a function of the main scene parameters.},

Multiple POL-inSAR signals, acquired from different positions, are used to estimate the height of buildings using the interferometry principle. High-performance array signal processing techniques are adapted to the case multi-baseline POL-InSAR (MBPI) observations, in order to enhance the height estimation of scatterers by calculating optimal polarization combinations and determining their scattering characteristics.

This model can be used to understand what information on geometric and dielectric properties of a building can be extracted from microwave remote sensing data. The geometrical model consists of a rectangular parallelepiped whose vertical walls form a generic angle with respect to the sensor line of flight. The parallelepiped is placed on a rough surface. The radar return from such a structure can be decomposed into single-scattering contributions from the (rough) ground, the building roof (a plane surface in our model), and vertical walls and multiple scattering contributions from dihedral structures formed by vertical walls and ground. In our model, single-scattering contributions are evaluated by using either physical optics (PO) or geometrical optics (GO), depending on surface roughness. In order to account for multiple scattering between buildings and terrain, we use GO to evaluate the field reflected by the smooth wall toward the ground (first bounce) or the sensor (second or third bounce) and GO or PO (according to ground surface roughness) to evaluate the field scattered by the ground toward the wall (first or second bounce) or the sensor (second bounce). Finally, the above model is used to analyze the field backscattered from a building as a function of the main scene parameters; in particular, the angle between vertical walls and sensor line of night and the dependence on the look angle are analyzed.},

The adopted models allow evaluation of the raw signal on a sound physical and mathematical background: the scattering model employs the Kirchhoff approach appropriately extended to include multiple-reflection effects, and the radar model operates in the two-dimensional Fourier transformed domain. Details to assess how and why the simulator is also efficient with respect to the computational time are provided. In addition, relevant examples are discussed to show the simulator potentialities and assess the validity of the main results. It is shown that the simulator is able to quantitatively assess performances of SAR sensors over urban structures.

Until now, most of the research activity in this field has been devoted to the attempt to retrieve geometric information on buildings in terms of their positions and sizes, by using simplified geometrical models. However, this approach does not allow us to fully exploit the large amount of information present in HR SAR images. In order to improve information retrieval from such images, and, hence, their interpretation, in this paper, we propose to employ a more refined model that accounts for both geometrical (including fine details) and electromagnetic properties of the building. A meaningful case study is presented to show that the main features appearing on the SAR image of a building can be interpreted by using our geometric and electromagnetic model. In addition, a first example of retrieval of the complex dielectric constant of building materials from a SAR image is presented.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent one of the most effective means to support activities in the sector of maritime surveillance. In the field of ship detection, many SAR-based algorithms have been proposed recently, but none of them has ever considered the electromagnetic aspects behind the interactions of SAR signals with the ship and surrounding waters, with the detection step and rate strongly influenced by relative thresholding techniques applied to the SAR amplitude or intensity image. This paper introduces a novel model to evaluate the radar cross section (RCS) backscattered from a canonical ship adapted, to the case at issue, from similar existing models developed for, and applied to, urban areas. The RCS is modeled using the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) within the geometrical optics (GO) solution and, following some assumptions on the scene parameters, derived by empirical observations; its probability density function is derived for all polarizations. An analysis of the sensitiveness of the RCS to the uncertainty on the input scene parameters is then performed. The new model is validated on two different TerraSAR-X images acquired in November 2012 over the Solent area in the U.K.: the RCS relevant to several isolated ships is measured and compared with the expected value deriving from the theoretical model here introduced. Results are widely discussed and ranges of applicability finally suggested.},

  abstract = {Objective performance assessment is a key enabling factor for the development of better and better image processing algorithms. In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) despeckling, however, the lack of speckle-free images precludes the use of reliable full-reference measures, leaving the comparison among competing techniques on shaky bases. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the objective (quantitative) assessment of SAR despeckling techniques, based on simulation of SAR images relevant to canonical scenes. Each image is generated using a complete SAR simulator that includes proper physical models for the sensed surface, the scattering, and the radar operational mode. Therefore, in the limits of the simulation models, the employed simulation procedure generates reliable and meaningful SAR images with controllable parameters. Through simulating multiple SAR images as different instances relevant to the same scene we can therefore obtain, a true multilook full-resolution SAR image, with an arbitrary number of looks, thus generating (by definition) the closest object to a clean reference image. Based on this concept, we build a full performance assessment framework by choosing a suitable set of canonical scenes and corresponding objective measures on the SAR images that consider speckle suppression and feature preservation. We test our framework by studying the performance of a representative set of actual despeckling algorithms; we verify that the quantitative indications given by numerical measures are always fully consistent with the rationale specific of each despeckling technique, strongly agrees with qualitative (expert) visual inspections, and provide insight into SAR despeckling approaches.},

The proposed processing chain is based on spectral analysis of the layover amplitude image, and exploits an adaptive filtering strategy to filter out the periodic components, in order to enhance the non-periodic component related to the presence of different objects on the portion of ground in front of the building, interested by the layover phenomenon.

  abstract = {With the launch of COSMO/SkyMed and TerraSARX missions, very high resolution (VHR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of urban areas have become routinely available. In particular, in the spotlight acquisition mode, COSMO/SkyMed SARs are able to obtain a resolution even better than one meter. Accordingly, in principle a huge amount of information on objects present in the urban scenario can be extracted from such images; however, due to the involved interaction between incident electromagnetic wave and imaged scene, direct interpretation of VHR SAR images is not straightforward, and different methods to analyze them are being developed by the scientific community. In this paper, we explore the potentiality of using the power spectral density (PSD) of VHR SAR amplitude images of urban areas for information extraction. First, we propose a theoretical model of the PSD of such images, and then we test the validity of the developed model on COSMO/SkyMed spotlight SAR images of urban areas. Finally, some suggestions are provided on how the parameters of the obtained PSD can be exploited to extract useful information from VHR SAR amplitude images of urban areas.},

However, at the same time, more new complexities and challenges are brought to the conventional SAR imaging algorithms. The back-projection algorithm and range migration algorithm are two newly developed algorithms that can be used in ultra-wideband SAR imaging. The back-projection algorithm originates from the medical imaging reconstruction technique called computer-aided tomography whereas the range migration algorithm is derived from seismic migration techniques. In the application to SAR imaging, the performance comparison is made in this paper based on theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental data. The analysis and processing results show that both algorithms are suitable for ultra-wideband SAR imaging and the theoretical resolution performances can be achieved. In addition, some practical issues of implementation and performance difference about these two algorithms are addressed as well},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image simulation can provide SAR target images under different scenes and imaging conditions at a low cost. These simulation images can be applied to SAR target recognition, image interpretation, 3-D reconstruction, and many other fields. With the accumulation of high-resolution SAR images of targets under different imaging conditions, the simulation process should be benefited from these real images. Accurate simulation parameters are one of the keys to obtain high-quality simulation images. However, it takes a lot of time, energy, and resources to get simulation parameters from actual target measurement or adjusting manually. It is difficult to derive the analytical form of the relation between a SAR image and its simulation parameter, so nowadays the abundant real SAR images can hardly help the SAR simulation. In this article, a framework is proposed to obtain the relationship between SAR images and simulation parameters by training the deep neural network (DNN), so as to extract the simulation parameters from the real SAR image. Two DNNs, convolutional neural network (CNN), and generative adversarial network (GAN) are used to implement this framework. By modifying the network structures and setting reasonable training data, our DNNs can learn the relationship between image and simulation parameters more effectively. Experimental results show that the DNNs can extract the simulation parameters from the real SAR image, which can further improve the similarity of the simulation image while automating the setting of simulation parameters. Compared with CNN, the simulation parameters extracted by GAN can achieve better results at multiple azimuth angles.},

A first step of registration allows us to get a fine superposition of optical and SAR building features. Then, we show how to take benefit from the introduction of SAR data: The proposed methodology, based on the optimization of criteria refering to building SAR characteristics, allows us to simultaneously deal with the building presence validation and with the height retrieval.},

The images are constructed for polarisations: horizontal-horizontal (HH) and vertical-vertical (VV), and different types of buildings, vegetation, and streets. Simulated images of a given area are compared with real SAR images of the same area acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite. The simulations use the measured backscatter coefficient for HH and VV polarisations and for five different classes of terrain: houses, trees, shrubs, grass, and ground. For multiple reflections, we apply the generalized bistatic Lambertian model. The results show that, despite the limits of the ray tracing method and the approximations involved in modelling three-dimensional objects in the simulated scene, the simulated SAR images correspond well with the actual scene. All features present in the real image are reproduced in the simulated image; in particular, the double reflections of buildings and the surrounding ground appear clearly. However, discrepancies exist, and these are also discussed.},
