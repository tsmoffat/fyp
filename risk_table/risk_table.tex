		Risk & Impact & Mitigation \\\hline
		Computer dies and can't be used & Delay project, some data may be lost & Data backed up automatically to iCloud and three weeks extra are built into the project to account for major delays, if there are more delays then non-key milestones can be removed \\
		&&\\
		Discover chosen tools can't perform required functions & Delays project while new tools have to be found and existing work is ported over & Three week grace period as mentioned previously, spend more time initially to ensure chosen tools can perform required functions \\
		&&\\
		Feature creep during design and implementation phase & Important features are delayed while unimportant features are added & Once the plan is finished stop adding features until all of the planned features are added then revisit the planned features, extra time is added into the project plan in order to facilitate this \\
		&&\\
		Eye strain & Work will be slowed down due to having to recover & Ensure workspace is set up properly initially following the University of Bath Health and Safety Standard provided, follow 20-20-20 rule \\
		&&\\
		Bug in program that makes the program unusable & Delay project due to debugging and re-writing & Extra time built in to project plan to deal with this \\
		&&\\
		Progress grinds to a halt due to the difficulty of implementation & Delay project & Fallbacks methods have been identified within MATLAB which can be used as a platform for more advanced implementation \\
